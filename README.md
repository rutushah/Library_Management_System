### Project Description :open_book:
A library management system is used to maintain library records. It tracks the records of the
number of books in the library, how many books are issued, or how many books have been
returned or renewed, or late fine charges, etc.
In the Skyline Library management, there are three different users who will be accessing the
website: The Admin, The Library Staff, and the Users, i.e., the members of the library.
The members need to register themselves by paying a bi-annual membership charge of $60.
The user who wants to register should also submit a photo ID proof for the address proof,
which will be viewed by the staff, and he will get an acknowledgement as soon as the
registration is successful.
The member can go through a lot of catalogues and select the book he wants to rent.
A member can rent 3 books at a time, and he needs to deposit one of the 3 pre-issued books if
he wants to take away the new book.
A book is issued for 3 weeks, and after that, there is a fine of $5 per week on the user's account.
A user can also download the available e-books free of charge. For a hard copy book, the
member needs to visit the library and get it issued. The location of the book can be seen online
on which rack it is in the library.
The staff will be responsible for keeping track of the books, issuing the books to the members,
and updating them in the database. The staff will be reviewing the submitted photo ID and
approving or declining the request.
The staff can block and unblock the members, and based on this, the members will be able to
rent books.
The staff will be adding new books and categories.
The admin can edit the library information fields, i.e. Address, Timings, Book return limit,
fines to be Imposed, And Even display an Urgent Message on the Website.
The Admin can view, add, or block the staff members. The Admin can also view the library
members as well. The Admin can also block a specific book from the list of books.
